We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a ~~server~~ render the page _on_ every request

You can use **_Static Generation_** for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
  - pages
    - `pages`

1. Blog posts
2. posts
3. test

- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation
